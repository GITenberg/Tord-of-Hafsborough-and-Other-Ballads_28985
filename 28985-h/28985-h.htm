5</span>TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH</h2>
<p>It was Tord of Hafsborough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the verdant wold would ride,<br />
And there he lost his hammer of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas lost for so long a tide.</p>
<p>It was Tord of Hafsborough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother he addressed:<br />
&ldquo;Thou shalt away to the Norland hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My hammer be thy quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Lokke Leyemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A feather robe o&rsquo;er him drew;<br />
And away to the Norland mountains high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the briny sea he flew.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>In the midst of the castle yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He smooth&egrave;d his array;<br />
Then straight he took to the castle hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the carlish Count his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be welcome, Lokke Leyemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be welcome my castle to;<br />
Say! how fare things in Hafsborough?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the land how does it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, well fare things in Hafsborough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well in the country all;<br />
Tord has his golden hammer lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore seek I your hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tord he shall not his hammer get,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou back may&rsquo;st carry him word;<br />
Full five-and-ninety fathoms deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It lies in the earth interred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tord he shall not his hammer get,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee I vow and swear,<br />
Save he give me Damsel Fridleifsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all his goods and gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>It was Lokke Leyemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er himself the feather robe drew;<br />
And with his answer back amain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the briny sea he flew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou never wilt get thy hammer of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that thou may&rsquo;st rely,<br />
Unless he have Damsel Fridleifsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all our property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered straight the proud Damsel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the bench as she sate:<br />
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better give me a Christian man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the laidly trold for mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will take our old father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And deck so fine his head,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll carry him to the Northern hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stand for bride in my stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now to the house of the merry bridegroom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They the young old bride convey;<br />
Upon her dress no gold was spared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a verity I say.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>And so they took the lovely bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the bride-bench placed her frame;<br />
And to skink before the bride himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The carlish Count he came.</p>
<p>Then she ate six oxen bodies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And three fat swine beside;<br />
Loaves seven hundred were her meal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere for a draught she cried.</p>
<p>Before her thirst she could assuage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank ten casks of ale;<br />
She set the can once more to her mouth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to hickuping then she fell.</p>
<p>The carlish Count strode up and down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wrung his hands so sore:<br />
&ldquo;O whence can this young bride be come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She does so much devour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count he called to his Botelere:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hadst better broach away,<br />
For we have here such a wondrous bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll drink for ever and aye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Answered then Lokke Leyemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath his sleeve he laughed with glee:<br />
&ldquo;For full eight days she has not ate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She longed so much for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outspake the laidly carlish Count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus the Count did cry:<br />
&ldquo;O, call ye in my serving swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them come instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, fetch me hither the hammer of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad I&rsquo;ll surrender it;<br />
If I can either in honour or shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of such a young bride be quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kempions eight in number were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who the hammer brought on a tree;<br />
They laid it down so courteously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the young bride&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>It was then the youthful bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took up the hammer big;<br />
I tell to ye for a verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She swung it like a twig.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>First she slew the carlish count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That throld both laid and tall;<br />
And then as they strove to &rsquo;scape through the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She slew the little trolds all.</p>
<p>The guests and the Norland men each one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So downcast were of mood;<br />
Blows from the hand of the bride they got<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That robbed their cheeks of blood.</p>
<p>It was Lokke Leyemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened his mouth in game:<br />
&ldquo;Now we will fare to our country home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our sire a widow proclaim.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>FROM THE ARABIC</h2>
<p>O thou who fain would&rsquo;st wisdom gain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Live night and day untired;<br />
For by repeated toil and pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is alone acquired.</p>

11</span>THORVALD<br />
<i>Svend Tveskjeg havde sig en Maud</i></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayne Tveskieg did a man possess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Thorvald hight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though fierce in war, kind acts in peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were his delight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From port to port his vessels fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sailed wide around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made, where&rsquo;er they anchor cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name renown&rsquo;d.<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners he bought&mdash;clothes,
liberty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On them bestowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sent men home from slavery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To their abode.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>And many an old man got his boy,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His age&rsquo;s stay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a maid her youth&rsquo;s sole joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lover gay.<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brave fight Thorvald loved full dear,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For brave his mood;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But never did he dip his spear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In feeble blood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He followed Swayne to many a fray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With war-shield bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his mere presence scar&rsquo;d away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foul deeds of might.<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hoist sail on the lofty mast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was King Swayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He o&rsquo;er the bluey billows pass&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With armed train.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leapt on shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every, every thing recoiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His might before.<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet slept not Bretland&rsquo;s chieftain
good;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He speedily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Collected a host in the dark wood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cavalry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And evil through that subtle plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Befell the Dane;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were ta&rsquo;en prisoners every man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last King Swayne.<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now hear thou prison-foogd! <a

band.&rdquo;<br />
<i>But Thorvald has freed his King</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man brought this intelligence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bower&rsquo;s door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Thorvald, with loud vehemence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go,&rdquo;
swore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&mdash;go, and leave my sovereign
here,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; No! Thorvald then ne&rsquo;er worthy were<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What cannot noble souls effect?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both freedom gain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Thorvald&rsquo;s prayer, and the respect<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His deeds obtain.<br />

brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit gratitude.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayne Tveskieg sat with kings one tide,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my compeers!<br />

16</span>PETER COLBIORNSEN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Fore Fredereksteen King Carl he
lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With mighty host;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Frederekshal from day to day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much trouble cost.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seize the sword each citizen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tools let fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And valiant Peter Colbiornsen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was first of all.<br />
<i>Thus for Norroway fight the Norsemen</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Gainst Frederekshal so fierce and
grim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned Carl his might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The citizens encountered him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In numbers slight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>But ah, they fought like Northern
men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For much loved land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was Peter Colbiornsen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led the band.<br />
<i>Thus for Norroway fight the Norsemen</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such heavy blows the Norsemen deal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like ripe corn &rsquo;fore the reaper&rsquo;s
steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swedes sink low.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But sturdiest reaper weary will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So happ&rsquo;d it here;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though many the Norwegians kill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More, more appear.<br />
<i>Thus for Norroway fight the Norsemen</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before superior force they flew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Norsemen fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They but retired, the fight anew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unawed to ply.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Now o&rsquo;er the bodies of his
slain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His way Carl makes;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he mistakes.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A speedy death his soldiers found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where&rsquo;er they came;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Norse were posted all around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And greeted them;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Carl he sent, but sorely vext,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Fredereksteen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And begg&rsquo;d that he might bury next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His slaughtered men.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No time, no time to squander

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have Norsemen bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He came self-bidden &rsquo;mongst us here,&rdquo;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Carl was told;<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! from the town the flames outburst,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But bullets fell as fast as snows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down from the fort.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now rose the blazes toward the sky,<br />

<p>&rsquo;Twas noised about, &rsquo;twas noised about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full far &rsquo;twas noised I ween;<br />
King Sigurd has his daughter lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She stolen from him has been.</p>
<p>It was gallant King Sigurd then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bonnet he put on;<br />
And he away to the high, high hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his courtmen and knights is gone.</p>
<p>They cast the die upon the board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The die it rolled around;<br />
It fell upon Regnfred, the King&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He to seek the maid is bound.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; And for winters five he sought;<br />
But he in all that weary tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could hear of the maiden nought.</p>
<p>It was Regnfred, the King&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the green wood rode his way;<br />
And there met him a little stranger lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the break of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, thou stranger lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All that I say to thee;<br />
The very next maid that thou know&rsquo;st of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do thou shew unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do thou hear, thou fair young swain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray I may not offend,<br />
But the very next maid that I know of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Tabor&rsquo;s goats doth tend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her kirtle is of kid-skin made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mantle of wadmal grey,<br />
Her locks, which shine like gleamy gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adown her shoulders stray.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Then he rode o&rsquo;er the meadows green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the brake and thorn,<br />
And there did he the maiden find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove her goats from the corn.</p>
<p>He took her tenderly in his arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kissed her on her cheek so fair:<br />
&ldquo;I entreat thee now by the highest God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy father to me declare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ancient man my father is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tends goats in the morass;<br />
Kragelill I myself am called,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I boast of my birth, alas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Regnfred, the King&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In haste drew out his knife:<br />
&ldquo;Thou shalt to me thy father name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or thou shall lose thy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigurd the King my father is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Queen my mother dear;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Regnfred, the King&rsquo;s good son;<br />
He lifted her so courteously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His courser grey upon.</p>
<p>And he rode o&rsquo;er the meadows green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the plains so wide;<br />
Behind him came running an ancient man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so loud on Kragelill cried.</p>
<p>But the swain gave him both silver and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Contented away he hied;<br />
Then he unhindered did carry the maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her father&rsquo;s halls of pride.</p>
<p>Now has Regnfred, the King&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;ercome his dire distress;<br />
He sleeps each night so joyously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the arms of his princess.</p>
<p>And now is Damsel Swanelill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To kith and kin restored;<br />
So joyously she sleeps each night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Regnfred her wedded lord.</p>

25</span>ALLEGAST</h2>
<p>The Count such a store of gold had got,<br />
His equal for wealth in the land was not.</p>
<p>But the Count he had of a hare the heart,<br />
At the slightest thing he with fear would start.</p>
<p>Yet at last he grew of courage so rife,<br />
That he wooed the King&rsquo;s daughter to be his wife.</p>
<p>Then answer made Carl, the son of the King:<br />
I ne&rsquo;er will consent to such shameful thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For he served my father like a knave,<br />
He&rsquo;ll not bear on his helm the stroke of a glaive.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Last year the King&rsquo;s coursers he helped to
groom,<br />
This year he&rsquo;ll to wed the King&rsquo;s daughter
presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nought booted all Carl, the King&rsquo;s son, could say;<br />
&rsquo;Gainst the wish of her brother they gave her away.</p>
<p>Dreamt Carl, the King&rsquo;s son, on his night-couch laid,<br
/>
That he would take up the thieving trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Lord God grant I the man may find,<br />
Who best can steal of the thieving kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that I in with Allegast fall,<br />
Who best can steal of the world&rsquo;s thieves all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early at morn the day shone clear,<br />
From the house Carl, the King&rsquo;s son, rode in career.</p>
<p>And when to the castle gate he had won,<br />
There Allegast stood, and leaned thereupon.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;What kind of man, my friend, may you be,<br />
Whom loitering here by the gate I see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks, young Sir, me Allegast call,<br />
I am the best thief of the world&rsquo;s thieves all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll to each other a solemn oath give,<br
/>
To steal and to thieve all the days that we live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will away to the house of the Count,<br />
And the courser we&rsquo;ll steal which to ride he is
wont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they arrived on the verdant plain,<br />
Into hot dispute fell the comrades twain.</p>
<p>They disputed which should break the wall,<br />
They disputed which therethrough should crawl.</p>
<p>But Allegast he should break down the wall,<br />
And Allegast he should creep through withall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall we bear the Count&rsquo;s saddle away?<br
/>
So many bells that saddle array.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>The Count to his page that evening said:<br />
&ldquo;My saddle wipe, ere thou get thee to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For to-morrow I&rsquo;m bent to ride to the Ting,<br />
I&rsquo;ll have Carl hanged, the son of the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Countess in bitter grief answer made:<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er live so long as to see him
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s servant last year thou wast,<br />
Now to sleep with his daughter the honour thou hast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count at that word so ireful grew,<br />
He smote his wife that the blood out-flew.</p>
<p>At hand was Sir Carl, heard all they spake:<br />
&ldquo;I soon of this matter an end will make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Carl he entered through the door,<br />
And a naked sword in his hand he bore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou dog, thou shalt never more have the might<br />
The gentle daughters of Kings to smite.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;Thou dog, thou shalt never more have the power<br
/>
To threaten Kings&rsquo; children within thy bower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count by his long yellow locks he took,<br />
And by the bed&rsquo;s side his head off strook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou lie there, and for ever be banned,<br />
I&rsquo;ll bestow on another my sister&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her Sir Allegast, he is a knight<br />
So true and trusty and valiant in fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s sweet daughter has Allegast wed,<br />
For her infamous husband unwept lies dead.</p>
<p>These gallants were thieves in no other way,<br />
Than that they a trick on the Count would play.</p>
<p>But could all thieving come to so fair an end,<br />
There&rsquo;s many, I trow, would a-thieving wend!</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
